# Senior Thesis

This thesis is a study on coral bleaching and coral mortality, studying the relationship between variables such as depth, exposure, distance to shore, and temperature for percent bleaching. All of the analyses were made using two different data sets, that contain information about bleaching events in specific regions, and dates, and provide information factors such as depth, temperature, and exposure. Models were created for different relationships of variables for eco-regions, recent data, and countries. 
I attempted to find relationships between variables such as depth, temperature, exposure, and distance to shore, and how they affect coral bleaching. Unfortunately, I did not find any meaningful relationships. There is a also case study on reefs found in Broward County, Florida derived from data from 2005 to 2006. I found a seemingly positive relationship between temperature and coral bleaching in this region. Coral bleaching events are worth studying because by finding the relationships between these variables and the levels of coral bleaching, this research can be used to slow the effects of coral bleaching and coral mortality.
